This repository is intended to host work in progress that I am doing on ActivityNet

This repository built upon the fork of activitynet/ActivityNet 
Crawler is modified for personal use
it contains some matlab and python script in corresponding folders

matlab script implement the functionality of reading the video and converting it into frames
python script has same ability and much faster in doing that
in add to that python also has script to re-save the annotation according to frame level annotations 
and a action class ID; action class IDs are from 1-200 continuous number, unlike nodeId that is provided

This repo has been under constant developement
please let me know if I break somthing on guru094@gmail.com
